The AI explains that task decomposition involves breaking down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, which can be done through various methods such as LLM prompting, task-specific instructions, and human input. This process enables agents to plan and manage their actions more effectively, allowing them to tackle complex tasks efficiently and effectively. Additionally, agents can use reflection and refinement to improve their performance by learning from past mistakes and adjusting their strategies for future steps. Overall, task decomposition and reflection are essential components of an agent's planning process.\" "
